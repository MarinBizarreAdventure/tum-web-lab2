# CashAppreciated - A Humorous Donation Landing Page

## Project Description

CashAppreciated is a lighthearted landing page created for Web Development Lab 2. This joke donation site combines humor with actual donation functionality through the "Buy Me A Coffee" widget.

The concept is simple and honest: no grand causes, no sob stories - just a student who needs coffee to fuel late-night coding sessions. The site uses humor to encourage small donations while providing a fun user experience.
